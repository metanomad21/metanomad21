## 🏆 About me

I have 5 years of experience in startup projects and 4 years of experience in game development. I specialize in blockchain core development, smart contract development, and I am a full-stack developer proficient in high-concurrency server architecture. I have developed large-scale online games, e-commerce websites, compliant financial smart contracts, and asset trading management platforms. I am particularly interested in on-chain games, GameFi, and zero-sum games. This repository contains some small projects I've worked on for fun.
